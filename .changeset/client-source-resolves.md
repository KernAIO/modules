Make the published client source resolvable.

A module ships `src/client` as source so consumers build the Svelte components with their own
toolchain, but that source imported `../contract/…` and `../kql/…` — paths under `src/` that the
tarball does not contain. It worked in the development workspace, where the whole repository is
linked, and failed in any real install with `Could not resolve '../kql/ast.js'`. The client now
refers to its own package's entry points, the way any other consumer would, and those entries carry
a `default` condition so resolvers that do not ask for `import` can find them too.
