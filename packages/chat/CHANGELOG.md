### Patch Changes

- b6e9f16: Make the published client source resolvable.

  A module ships `src/client` as source so consumers build the Svelte components with their own
  toolchain, but that source imported `../contract/…` and `../kql/…` — paths under `src/` that the
  tarball does not contain. It worked in the development workspace, where the whole repository is
  linked, and failed in any real install with `Could not resolve '../kql/ast.js'`. The client now
  refers to its own package's entry points, the way any other consumer would, and those entries carry
  a `default` condition so resolvers that do not ask for `import` can find them too.
