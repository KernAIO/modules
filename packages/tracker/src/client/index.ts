/**
 * Tracker client entry.
 *
 * The pieces a host application needs to talk to the tracker and to render it the way `DESIGN.md`
 * describes, with no framework in them: a typed API client, the presentation rules for statuses,
 * priorities and due dates, grouping for the list and the board, fractional ranks for drag and drop,
 * and a KQL reader for the query box.
 *
 * The Svelte views themselves live in the host app (`repos/app/src/lib/modules/tracker`) for now:
 * the shell renders module pages as real SvelteKit routes rather than through `ClientModule.routes`,
 * so shipping components from here would have nowhere to be mounted.
